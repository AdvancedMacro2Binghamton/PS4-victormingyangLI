The results can be found in 'PS4 Written Questions.pdf'.
The main program is PS4.m. Two function files are grid_search.m and pol_fn_iter.m.

I had problems in the last two parts:
6. I got the same interest rate as in the complete markets. 
   I didn't find a significant difference between the wealth distributions of Aiyagari and Huggett.
   I am not clear about which 'empirical wealth distribution' to look at.
7. I found policy function iteration slower than value function iteration.
   I didn't succeed in creating the linear interpolation approach.
